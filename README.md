# droidscript-alt

An alternate interface for [DroidScript](http://droidscript.org/) to `app.*`.

This project is currently in beta and unstable: large chunks of code may suddenly change or appear.

## Why is this a thing?

*This wasn't created because DroidScript is broken, it works great.*

I started out wanting a better way to organize my code than what was offered. I just wanted to write a quick type file and use TypeScript and Rollup to pull everything together. Suddenly it was like finding out how sausage was made.
